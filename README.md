**CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

---

### **Aim**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers at risk of churning. By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies, reduce customer attrition, and improve overall profitability.

---

### **Theory**

Customer Churn refers to the loss of customers over a specified period. Predicting customer churn involves identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior that indicate an increased likelihood of churn. This information can be leveraged to implement timely interventions and retention strategies.

Machine Learning provides a powerful framework for building predictive models. In this context, we employ classification algorithms to categorize customers as either 'churning' or 'not churning'.

**Key Concepts Implemented:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Involves handling missing values, outliers, and converting categorical data into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. This step ensures data quality and consistency.

- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. For instance, creating features based on customer tenure, service usage patterns, or demographic information.

- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on dataset characteristics and problem requirements. Common choices for churn prediction include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

- **Model Training:** Feeding the preprocessed data to the chosen algorithm to learn patterns and relationships between features and the target variable (churn).

- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. This helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.

### **Algorithm **

To predict customer churn, we use a machine learning model called **Random Forest**. First, we prepare the customer data by cleaning it and converting information into a format the model can understand. Then, we split the data into training and testing sets. The model learns patterns from the training data to predict whether a customer will churn or not. We evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, we visualize the results using a confusion matrix to understand how well the model performs.


### **Conclusion**

The developed customer churn prediction model effectively identifies customers at risk of churning. By leveraging machine learning techniques and incorporating relevant customer data, the model provides valuable insights into customer behaviour. The model's performance demonstrates its ability to accurately predict churn.
